# About

This is a Node.JS project for interfacing with Domoticz, a home automation control panel. This is essentially a replacement UI built for mobile and tablet consumption. It's sole purpose is to build an easy and attractive interface to turn lights, fans, and other switch-based hardware on and off. Has limited support for scenes (work in progress) and security sensors, such as motion and door/window sensors, and finally, support for graphing temperatures.

Utilizes Express for static file serving and API handling, and socket.io for websocket and real-time streaming.
